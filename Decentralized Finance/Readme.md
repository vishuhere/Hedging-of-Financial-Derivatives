# Cryptocurrency Analysis and Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze historical cryptocurrency data and build a predictive model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The code retrieves historical cryptocurrency prices from Yahoo Finance, visualizes the data, and trains an LSTM model to predict future prices.

## Analysis Techniques
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks are used for time series prediction.
The model is trained on historical cryptocurrency price data.
## Results
Visualizations of historical cryptocurrency prices.
Predicted cryptocurrency prices for future time periods.
