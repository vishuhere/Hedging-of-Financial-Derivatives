# **Beta-Weighted Stock Portfolio**
**Introduction** <br>
A beta-weighted stock portfolio evaluates the risk relative to the market by considering each stock's beta. Beta measures a stock's volatility in relation to the market. A beta of 1 indicates that the stock moves with the market. A beta greater than 1 indicates higher volatility than the market, while a beta less than 1 indicates lower volatility.
